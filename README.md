CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. Applied Principal component analysis (PCA) to speed up the machine learning classification algorithm. Max Accuracy of 55% was achieved by support vector classifier (SVC) which can be further improved by using CNN'S.
